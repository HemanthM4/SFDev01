So what happens next?

Please check your booking details and if anything’s incorrect or needs to change, please get in touch using one of the links below.

Then once we’ve allocated a tradesperson, we’ll send a text message with a more accurate estimated arrival time.

When we’re at your property

If you’ve booked an hourly rate job, once the tradesperson has finished their initial investigation, you can ask them to provide a fixed price quote to complete the work.

All of our tradespeople are extremely knowledgeable and friendly. They’ll be happy to answer any questions you have about the work they’re carrying out at your property.

As soon as the work is finished, the tradesperson will ask for your signature to confirm that you’re happy with the work and the final cost.

Should there be any problems on the day, e.g. we’re unable to gain access to your property, or the tradesperson is held up, we’ll inform you straight away via text message.

What if you’re unhappy with the work?

You’re our number one priority. If for any reason you’re dissatisfied with the work, please get in touch straight away using one of the links below.

Our cancellation policy

Please note; if you want to cancel your booking once we’ve allocated a tradesperson, you may be charged a cancellation fee. See our cancellation policy for more details.
