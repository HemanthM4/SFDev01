Your Onboarding

Dear {!Engineer_Application__c.First_Name__c},

We had you scheduled for an Onboarding day in our office, but it looks like you didn’t make it. We hope everything is well.

This is the last stage of the application process before you can work with us, so if you’d like to rebook the Onboarding session, please follow this link: Rebook Trial

Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions.

Kind Regards,

Resources Team
