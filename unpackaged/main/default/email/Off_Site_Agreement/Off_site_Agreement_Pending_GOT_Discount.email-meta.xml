What’s next?

Once we’ve received the deposit, we’ll order any required materials and confirm your appointment via email. If materials or availability result in us not being able to meet your requested appointment date, we’ll be in touch to find a day and time frame that suits you best.

If you want to discuss the scope of works, materials, or the agreed price, simply  contact us here.

How we charge for the job

Once we’ve received a deposit covering 50% of the estimate, we can proceed with the job. Once the works are done and you’re happy with the outcome, our operative will obtain your signature and the remaining balance will be taken form the last card you provided us with. If you want to amend your card details, simply  contact us here.

Off-site agreements

Off-site agreements are designed to take into account the investigation of the required works, trusted trade knowledge, trade accredited body requirements such as evidence and certification, and any registrations that we must undertake.

In case the works take less or more time than calculated for, the charge to you will remain the same.

In case of having to amend the scope of work, we’ll reach out to you to discuss any change in costs before proceeding. Examples of situations in which this may happen include uncovering structural or component damage, adjustments to your request or previously concealed findings such as a pre-existing leak under a floor. For more information, please read our  terms and conditions.

Our cancellation policy

If you want to cancel your booking, you may be charged a cancellation fee. For more information please read our  terms and conditions.

Happy with the job done?

Your satisfaction is our number one priority. If you’re unhappy with the works done or wish to speak to us for any reason before, during or following the visit,  please get in touch straight away.

Help made easy.
