Hi {!asp04__Authorisation__c.asp04__First_Name__c},

We currently don’t have a valid payment method on file for your account which means we can’t confirm your booking yet. Don’t worry, we will only use your card to validate the booking. Payment will only be taken upon completion of the job, at which point you also have the option to use alternative payment methods.

To complete your booking, please add your card details here: {!asp04__Authorisation__c.asp04__eCommerce_URL__c}.

You will receive a separate email with a booking confirmation.
