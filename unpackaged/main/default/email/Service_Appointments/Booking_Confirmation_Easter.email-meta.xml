WHAT&#39;S NEXT?

Once we’re on our way, you’ll receive an email with an estimated arrival time.

ON THE DAY

If you’ve booked an hourly rate job, once the initial investigation is done, you can ask for a fixed-price quote to complete the work. 						As soon as the work is finished, you’ll be asked for a signature to confirm you’re happy with the work and the final cost. 						Should there be any problems on the day, e.g. we can’t gain access to your property, or the tradesperson’s held up, we’ll inform you straight away.

HOW WE CHARGE

For hourly rate jobs, there’s a minimum 1-hour charge, then we bill in half-hour increments. Parts and materials are charged on top of the tradesperson’s time. We carry standard parts and materials, but if anything extra’s needed, a £50 collection fee will be added to the bill. 						For pre-defined fixed-price jobs, we charge the rate quoted. There’ll be no extra charges for parts, materials or collections. 						For more information visit our pricing overview or read our terms and conditions.

OUR CANCELLATION POLICY

If you want to cancel your booking once we’ve allocated a tradesperson, you may be charged a cancellation fee. For more information please check our cancellation policy.

From emergency repairs to large scale refurbishment work and everything in between, we&#39;re here to help. 						If you have any questions about your order please get in touch or take a look at our full list of  trades.

Help made easy.
