( Duration /24) + 
(FLOOR(Duration/8)*16)/24

/*First line is just Arrival Window End as a date/time
2nd line adds a fraction of a day to this date/time where the fraction. We want to represent the duration as a fraction of a day - which is 24 hours, so thats why we divide the duration by 24.

3rd line: Adding in the Home time (break between days) we divide the duration by 8 to get the number of full working days that this Appointment is going to cover, e.g. 8 hrs=1 full day, 32 would be 4 full days etc etc. We times it by 16 to give us, for each full day, a home time of 16 hours.

the /24 is to get it as a fraction of a day.

Engineers must have 16 hrs rest
Example got 10hr job, we start at 12:00 and therefore finish at 20:00, hometime hasa to be 16 hrs, therefore earliest can return next day is 12:00 (8pm + 16 hours) and then 2 hrs remaining, so that brings us to 14:00 on the next day.
